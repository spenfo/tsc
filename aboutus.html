		<h3>"I want you to see you in your writing..."</h3>
		<p>This phrase was the inspiration for the great Tristopher Tigris Tibolt III to create Tristopher Supply Co. Born in New York in 1935, Tristopher learned to love writing letters in his early years.
		He started his own business in 1965 and called it Tristopher Supply Co. He had a vision of a world where people would put their heart and soul into their letters. 
		Today, at Tristopher Supply Co. we use the finest quality waxes, parchments, and stamps to bring you a writing experience like no other.</p>
